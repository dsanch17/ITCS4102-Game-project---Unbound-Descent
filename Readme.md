## Background

This project was done for ITCS 4102 - Intro To Game Design at The University of North Carolina at Charlotte.
This game was built in Unity with C#. I served as the Team Lead and Lead Programmer of a team of 4 people as we spent a semester working on this final project.

## Overview

The game is a 2D puzzle platformer in which the player must collect a key and get to the exit of each level. The player has control over gravity and must change gravity in all 4 directions to avoid obstacles and reach the exit.

Most of the heavy lifting for the programming can be found in the playerController file which handles movement, death detection, and gravity changes among other things.
